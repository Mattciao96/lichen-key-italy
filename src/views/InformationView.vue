<!--  start info here    -->

      <p class="mb-6">This tool generates keys to subsets of species defined by their distribution, traits and ecological requirements. The keys are obtained from <a href="https://dryades.units.it/home/index.php?procedure=ext_key_home&key_type=lic&key_id=1692" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">the general key to the lichens of Italy by P.L. Nimis</a>, by eliminating all species which do not share the specified characters. There are 3 main filters:</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-zinc-900 mt-8 mb-[12px]">General Filter</h2>
      <div class=" mb-12 space-y-3">
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Taxa to work on:</span> the general key includes both the species actually known from Italy, and those known from neighbouring countries, whose presence in Italy is possible. If you have collected your lichen outside Italy, or if you are a professional lichenologists eager to discover species which are new to Italy, the first option is advised. Of course, with that option you cannot filter the species by administrative region, ecoregion, and commonness/rarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Administrative region:</span> Italy has 20 administrative regions, but, following Nimis (2016), the region Friuli Venezia Giulia has been split into two separate Operational Geographic Units (Friuli and Venezia Giulia). A list and a map of the administrative regions is  <a href="https://italic.units.it/index.php?procedure=base&t=59&c=60#distribution" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Ecoregion:</span> nine ecoregions are distinguished within Italy, based on several tematic maps (elevation, precipitation etc.), and also taking into account the difference between the Tyrrhenian (humid) and Adriatic (dry) part of the Peninsula, which is relevant in influencing lichen distribution in the country. A map of the ecoregions is <a href="https://italic.units.it/index.php?procedure=base&t=59&c=60#commonness" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Commonness / Rarity:</span> the related concepts of "commonness" and "rarity" are difficult to define, and hence intrinsically fuzzy ones. A given species might be fairly "common" in a narrow area, while it may be extremely rare when the area is made broader. For example, <i>Cetraria islandica</i> is fairly common in the Alps, rare along the Apennines, extremely rare in the mountains of Sicily, and certainly absent in the Po-Plain. As there is obviously no sense in specifying the "commonness" of a species nationwide, a commonness-rarity value was assigned to each species for each of the 9 ecoregions, on the basis of three main criteria : a) number of samples in the TSB lichen herbarium (% on the total for each phytoclimatic area), b) number of citations in the literature, c) an expert assessment used in particular cases (e.g. that of recently-described taxa).  Commonness-rarity is expressed on a 8-class scale, from “extremely rare” to “extremely common”. Filtering the species by commonness/rarity may be useful e.g. for teachers who want to produce a key to the most common species of a given area.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Non-lichenized species:</span>  non-lichenized species are included only when: a) they are frequently treated by lichenologists because of their resemblance to lichenized species (e.g. <i>Chaenothecopsis</i>), b) they belong to genera with lichenized representatives (e.g. <i>Arthonia</i>). This option permits to include/exclude non-lichenized species from the query.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Genus:</span> here you can ask for a key to species of a given genus. If combined with the following trait and ecological filters, you can ask for things like “a key of all silicicolous species of <i>Rinodina</i> with a K+ yellow thallus occurring below the alpine belt in Lombardy”. Generic delimitations strictly follow those adopted in ITALIC and are being continuously updated.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Family:</span> The same as before, but at family level.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-zinc-900 mt-8 mb-[12px]">Trait Filter</h2>
      <p class="mb-12">Here, species can be filtered by some important morphological and chemical traits. In the future, further traits will be added. Notice that some species with ambiguous morphology or chemistry may appear under two contrasting options, e.g. some species of <i>Acarospora</i> appear both among those with a crustose thallus and among those with a squamulose thallus. The last option of this filter requires some attention by first-time users: it should be used for crustose phycolichens only, to include/exclude sterile crusts.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-zinc-900 mt-8 mb-[12px]">Ecological Filter</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Using this filter, by combining different ecological parameters, you can define "virtual habitats" and obtain keys to the species which are most likely to occur there.</p>
      <ul class="space-y-3 list-none mb-12">
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Substrata:</span> the substrata are:
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>bark and wood</li>
            <li>rocks (incl. artificial substrata such as glass and mortar)</li>
            <li>soil, terricolous mosses, and plant debris</li>
            <li>living leaves (foliicolous lichens)</li>
          </ul>
          The substrata are tailored to the ecological behaviour of the species in Italy. In strongly oceanic or strongly continental areas (hardly present in Italy) substrate shifts are common.
        </li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Ecological indicator values:</span> these are expert assessments that qualitatively express the ecological range of species with respect to different factors. Those used here were originally proposed by Nimis (2016) and are being continuously updated in ITALIC: they specify, for each factor and for each species, a range on a 5-class ordinal scale, as follows:
          <ul class="pl-4 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <span class="font-semibold">pH of the substratum</span>
              <ul class=" pl-6 ">
                <li>1 - on very acid substrata, such as lignum, conifer bark and very acid siliceous rocks (quartzite, rhyolite, etc.)</li>
                <li>2 - on acid substrata, such on non-eutrophicated bark of <i>Quercus</i>, and acid siliceous rocks (granite, non-calciferous sandstones, etc.)</li>
                <li>3 - on subneutral substrata, such as the bark of <i>Sambucus</i>, and base-rich siliceous rocks (basalt, weakly calciferous siliceous rocks, etc.)</li>
                <li>4 - on slightly basic substrata, such as dust-covered bark, strongly calciferous siliceous rocks  (schists, sandstones, etc.)</li>
                <li>5 - on basic substrata, mostly calcareous soil and rocks (pure limestone, mortar, etc.)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-semibold">Light (solar irradiation)</span>
              <ol class=" pl-6 ">
                <li>1 - in very shaded situations, e.g. deep gorges, closed evergreen forests</li>
                <li>2 - in shaded situations, such in close-canopied deciduous forests, or in rather open evergreen forests</li>
                <li>3 - in sites with plenty of diffuse light but scarce direct solar irradiation, such as in rather open-canopied deciduous woodlands, and north-facing surfaces in exposed sites</li>
                <li>4 - in sun-exposed sites, but avoiding extreme solar irradiation, such as on horizontal surfaces in exposed sites.</li>
                <li>5 - in sites with very high direct solar irradiation, such as on the southern side of exposed surfaces.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-semibold">Xerophytism (aridity)</span>
              <ol class=" pl-6 ">
                <li>1 - hydro- and hygrophytic, in aquatic or marine situations, or in sites with a very high frequency of fog</li>
                <li>2 - rather hygrophytic, intermediate between 1 and 2</li>
                <li>3 - mesophytic</li>
                <li>4 - xerophytic, but absent from extremely arid stands</li>
                <li>5 - very xerophytic.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-semibold">Eutrophication (incl. deposition of dust and nitrogen compounds):</span>
              <ol class=" pl-6 ">
                <li>1 - not resistant to eutrophication</li>
                <li>2 - resistant to a very weak eutrophication</li>
                <li>3 - resistant to a weak eutrophication</li>
                <li>4 - occurring in rather eutrophicated situations</li>
                <li>5 - occurring in highly eutrophicated situations.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The predictivity of these values may vary considerably among species, depending on the degree of knowledge on their ecology. For poorly known species the values are tentative, and mostly based on information available in the literature. For species known from the type collection only, they are based on the info contained in the protologue or on the envelope of the type material. We suggest to use the indicator values with prudence, until you have understood how they work. They may be, however, particularly useful to differentiate between different rock types such as limestone and acid siliceous rocks, or between  shaded and very sunny habitats.</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Poleotolerance:</span> this value points to the tendency of a lichen to occur in areas with different degrees of human disturbance. It is expressed on 4 classes, as follows:
          <ol class=" pl-6 ">
            <li>3 - species present in heavily disturbed areas, incl. large towns</li>
            <li>2 - species present in moderately disturbed areas (agricultural areas, small settlements etc.)</li>
            <li>1 - species present in natural or semi-natural habitats</li>
            <li>0 - species which exclusively occur on old trees in ancient, undisturbed forests.</li>
          </ol>
          Contrary to the other values, the value "0" has been assigned to epiphytic species only, since it is useful to point out indicators of long ecological continuity of forests. Poleotolerance values can be used to obtain keys to e.g. lichens occurring in large towns.
        </li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Altitudinal distribution:</span> This value reflects the distribution of species along an altitudinal gradient, mainly defined by potential vegetation. It can be used as a proxy of the ecoregions, if you have chosen to include in the query also the species not actually known from Italy. The altitudinal belts are:
          <ol class=" pl-6 ">
            <li>1 - eu-Mediterranean belt (potential vegetation: evergreen <i>Quercus ilex</i> forest)</li>
            <li>2 - submediterranean belt (deciduous <i>Quercus-Carpinus</i> forests)</li>
            <li>3 - montane belt (<i>Fagus</i> forests, marking treeline in the Apennines)</li>
            <li>4 - subalpine and oroboreal belts of the Alps (natural <i>Picea abies</i>, and <i>Larix-Pinus cembra</i> stands)</li>
            <li>5 - above treeline (both Alpine and oromediterranean)</li>
            <li>6 - nival belt of the Alps.</li>
          </ol>
          For Sardegna, which hosts a very peculiar vegetation somehow resembling that of parts of the Iberian peninsula, where the beech belt is missing, the altitudinal subdivision was adjusted to the local situation.  The altitudinal range of species reflects their behaviour in Italy. If you have collected your lichen in other parts of Europe, consider that the situation in your area may be quite different.
        </li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Special requirements for water:</span>
          <ul class=" pl-6 ">
            <li>u – species growing on surfaces rarely wetted by rain (e.g. under overhangs)</li>
            <li>w – species growing on otherwise dry surfaces with short periods of water seepage after rain</li>
            <li>l – species which are periodically submerged (e.g. in creeks)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Species of metal-rich substrata:</span> you can limit your query to species growing on metal-rich siliceous rocks, or exclude these species from the query.</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Phytoclimatic range:</span>
          <ul class="pl-6 ">
            <li>oc - restricted to humid-warm, oceanic areas</li>
            <li>suboc - most common in areas with a humid-warm climate (e.g. most of Tyrrhenian Italy)</li>
            <li>subc - subcontinental: restricted to areas with a dry-subcontinental climate (e.g. dry Alpine valleys, parts of Mediterranean Italy)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Costal species:</span> you can limit your query to species bound to coastal-maritime situation, or exclude these species from the query. If you use this parameter to define a "virtual habitat" consider however that the system will produce a key only to strictly coastal species, while coastal habitats also host many other species with a much broader ecology.</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold">Parasitic species:</span> you can limit your query to species growing on other lichens, or exclude these species from the query. If you want to limit your query to lichenicolous lichens, remember to exclude non-lichenized species in the general filter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-zinc-900 mt-8 mb-[12px]">The Output</h2>
      Once a query is completed, the system produces:
      <div class="mb-12">
      <ul class="space-y-1 pl-6 mb-2">

        <li>A) A photo gallery of the species resulting from the query. Clicking on an image you may see more pictures of the species, if available.</li>
          <li>B) A list of the species resulting from the query. Clicking on a species name, you are redirected to the corresponding taxon page in ITALIC.</li>
            <li>C) A key in 4 different formats (the first 3 are printable):
              <ul class="pl-6 list-disc">
                <li>Illustrated (with pictures of species and descriptions),</li>
                  <li>Not illustrated (with descriptions only),</li>
                    <li>Plain (only the dichotomous skeleton, without pictures and descriptions),</li>
                      <li>Interactive (also including pictures of characters).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
      </ul>
        <p>
      Clicking on a species name in any type of key, you are redirected to the corresponding taxon page of  ITALIC. The function “adjust key” permits to delete some species from a key: it may be useful e.g. for teachers who want to produce a printable key, for example to the epiphytic lichens of a given city, excluding species that they have never found in their area, or which make the key too difficult for their students.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">Every key is conserved by the system: if you intend to use a given key several times, just copy-paste its URL. You can also incorporate that URL into an external, dedicated web page (e.g. on the lichens of a Natural Park, or on a school project of biomonitoring).</p>
